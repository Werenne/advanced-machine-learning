## Advanced Machine Learning

This repository contains my assignments of the "Advanced Machine Learning" course given by Professors Pierre Geurts & Gilles Louppe at the University of Li√®ge. Official link to the course can be found [here](https://github.com/glouppe/info8004-advanced-machine-learning).

### Assignments

For each assignment we had to read a research paper on a machine learning topic. Then, a report in the form of a review paper had to be written.
